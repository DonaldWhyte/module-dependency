TESTS
-----

Unit tests are provided in the 'tests' directory. To run all the unit tests
simply navigate into the 'tests' directory and invoke the following command:

python run_test.py -d .. -w .

To run a single test file, invoke the following command in the 'tests'
directory:

python run_test.py -d .. -w . -t "[TEST_NAME]"

[TEST_NAME] is the name of the test file without the "test_" prefix or ".py"
suffix. For example, if [TEST_NAME] = filterers, then the test file
"test_filterers.py" will be executed.
